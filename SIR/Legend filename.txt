Each folder is named following the rule:

N_I0_delta_beta(A)_beta(E)_beta(Y)_rbeta(A)_rbeta(E)_rbeta(Y)_gammaIR(A)_gammaIR(E)_gammaIR(Y)_muf(A)_muf(E)_muf(Y)_mufeardist(A)_mufeardist(E)_mufeardist(Y)_sigmafeardist_alpha(A)_alpha(E)_alpha(Y)

N: total number of nodes
I0: total number of initial infected nodes
beta: transmission rate (per age class)
rbeta: rescaling factor for transmission rate when feared (per age class)
gammaIR: recovery rate from I to R state (per age class)
muf: transition rate Sf + S -> 2S (per age class) or even Sf + R -> S + R FEAR REMOVAL

mufeardist: mean of the normal distribution we sample from when spontaneous S -> Sf (per age class)
sigmafeardist: std of the normal distribution we sample from when spontaneous S->Sf
alpha: rescaling factor for beta in Sf+S -> 2Sf (per age class)
